Sliding window:
- Fixed length
- Variable length

Problem you had was how to maintain the frequency table when sliding along, the window itself wasn't hard to see.

I've seen this trick where they use a 26 long array to be the frequency table rather than an explicit hashmap.

Really stuck on this one, I'm not sure why my recursive attempt bruteforce searching all substrings isn't exploring all substrings?

Aims for today:
- Understand two pointer solution for 844
-

The test set for sliding window is _really_ hard. Maybe need to go do some more practice on easies/mediums.
