# Revised plan (2024-04-24)

Focus on getting array stuff down to a pat.

3231 is not useful for me right now, because you can't even just _do_ leetcodes on the spot


# New plan

- Complete the 12-week plan here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKP-Vca9Q4c  (this goes through things strategy by strategy but is optimized for "most common questions" i.e. half your time is spent on array processing)
- Complete `neetcode.io`  (this goes through things topic by topic, more DSA-y I guess)
- Complete Grind 75 (generic list, but it was too hard to go through this initially because it wasn't topic/skill focused. But I think by the time I get to this, I'll have more tools in my toolbox.)

After this, should examine closer what other tools I need/where my weaknesses are that need to improve.

# Old plan
It's been a real slog to not feel like I'm constantly bashing my head against a wall, and I certainly don't want to be learning this stuff like I was a kNN, because it ain't gonna generalise.

Decided I'll follow the plan here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKP-Vca9Q4c
- I've learnt a lot of this stuff before but it's all in bits and pieces and not systematically.
- Some of these things actually have a higher level view/theory on why it works (like how you can look at shortest path algorithms with abstract algebra); this is nice but you should not care too much at the moment.

Learning about algorithms, algorithmic design and analysis is a separate issue, the real problem I'm having is building some _practical_ intuition to grok the correctness/ intuitively know whether something will work or not. Which I don't just "have" right now.

Yes, at some point I will read all of CLRS before I do 3121 but the objective is be able to _do_ stuff first.

## A man, a plan, a canal
Step 1 of my algorithms journey is learn a basic set of useful tools/patterns so I have more than a unsharpened teaspoon in my toolbox to solve problems with.
- Trying to close the gap between what I know about and what I can solve on the spot

Spend 90 mins a day, barring one day for rest. Go find time to do this.

Keep a progress journal.
