# leetcode 

It's been a real slog to not feel like I'm constantly bashing my head against a wall, and I certainly don't want to be learning this stuff like I was a kNN, because it ain't gonna generalise.

Decided I'll follow the plan here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKP-Vca9Q4c
- I've learnt a lot of this stuff before but it's all in bits and pieces and not systematically.
- Some of these things actually have a higher level view/theory on why it works (like how you can look at shortest path algorithms with abstract algebra); this is nice but you should not care too much at the moment.

Learning about algorithms, algorithmic design and analysis is a separate issue, the real problem I'm having is building some _practical_ intuition to grok the correctness/ intuitively know whether something will work or not. Which I don't just "have" right now.

Yes, at some point I will read all of CLRS before I do 3121 but the objective is be able to _do_ stuff first.

## A man, a plan, a canal
Step 1 of my algorithms journey is learn a basic set of useful tools/patterns so I have more than a unsharpened teaspoon in my toolbox to solve problems with.
- Trying to close the gap between what I know about and what I can solve on the spot

Spend 90 mins a day, barring one day for rest. Go find time to do this.
